        <h1 id="title">The Greatest Villains of All Time</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Every good movie has a villain, some antagonists trying to keep our heroes from achieving greatness (or just, you know, surviving). Movie villains can be straight out of our worst nightmares, the serial killers and monsters who only plague our minds as we're trying to go to sleep. Whether you're haunted by <i>Michael Myers, Freddy Kreuger, Hannibal Lecter,</i> or <i>Darth Vader</i>, the great villains of cinema history are the ones who stay with you long after the credits roll. </p>
        <p class="parrafo2">Have you ever thinked about which are the <strong><i>greatest evil personalities</i></strong> ever created in the history of the <i>7th Art?</i></p>

        <figcaption class="figcaption1">Played By: Tim Curry</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="figcaption2">Movie: IT (1990)</figcaption>
        <p id="penny-p1">The premise of Stephen King’s instant classic novel It is that clowns are secretly terrifying. The only thing scarier than clowns? Really long books: It is truly scary in its length, clocking in at over a thousand pages.</p>
        <p id="penny-p2">Not only is Pennywise the personification of child fear, but also bigotry and hate, with the number of historical atrocities his presence has inspired in the town of Derry, Maine. A scary clown could potentially come off as cheesy, but Tim Curry’s performance is perfectly unsettling and memorable. A scarier clown has yet to be seen in pop culture, and hopefully never will be.

                <figcaption class="figcaption1">Played By: Anthony Hopkins</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="figcaption2">Movie: The Silence of the Lambs (1991)</figcaption>
        <p id="hannibal-p1">There have been many cannibals in film history, but only one who could make us swear off our favorite meal: liver and fava beans with a nice chianti. A brilliant psychiatrist and human flesh-eating serial killer who appears in five movies and an upcoming television series, Dr. Hannibal “The Cannibal” Lecter is at his best in 1991’s The Silence of the Lambs, where the imprisoned doc guides young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) in a game of quid pro quo as she pursues “Buffalo Bill,” a homicidal sociopath who’s fashioning himself a woman suit out of real woman-skin.</p>

        <figcaption class="figcaption1">Played By: Malcolm McDowell</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="figcaption2">Movie: A Clockwork Orange (1971)</figcaption>
        <p id="alex-p1">Alex becomes the means through which viewers are made to understand free will in the face of government control, but he's still a monster. Malcolm McDowell imbues him with terrible charisma and, let's be honest, cool, but he's still an amoral beast who'd kick your teeth in without a second thought.</p>

        <figcaption class="figcaption1">Played By: Robert Englund</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="figcaption2">Movie: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)</figcaption>
        <p>While sleeping, people are at their most vulnerable, making it nearly impossible to stop Krueger from offing whomever he pleases in gory, imaginative ways. Furthermore, nobody can stay awake forever, so, eventually, whether it's after a week or two months or longer, you're going to enter Freddy's domain. And the outcome won't be ideal. </p>

        <figcaption class="figcaption1">Played By: David Prowse, James Earl Jones (voice)</figcaption>
        <figcaption class="figcaption2">Movie: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)</figcaption>
        <p id="vader-p1">After suffering the loss of the most important people in his life, including his mother and his wife, his sadness turned into rage, eventually turning him into the masked and heavy-breathing monster sitting in the display cases on fanboys everywhere.</p>
        <p id="vader-p2">Although Vader is first introduced in the original trilogy as a ruthless cyborg, killing anyone who stands in his path to galactic domination, by the final film, he's using his last ounce of humanity to sacrifices himself to save his son's life. What makes Darth Vader one of the greatest villains ever is the fact that he wasn't really a villain to begin with</p>
